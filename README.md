# Ames Housing Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa, using various machine learning techniques. The dataset contains a series of attributes about the residential homes in Ames, which have been used to train models to predict house prices.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information from the Ames Assessor’s Office used in computing assessed values for individual residential properties sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. 

- `train.csv` - training set containing features and target price
- `test.csv` - test set, containing features without the target price

## Features
The dataset contains features such as the type and quality of various home attributes (e.g., type of alley access, quality of the material on the exterior, the state of the basement’s height, etc.). The target variable is the Sale Price of the house.

## Technical Stack
- **Python**: Main programming language used.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and ingestion.
- **NumPy**: For numerical data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code development and data analysis.

## Requirements
To install the required libraries, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
You can create a requirements.txt file in your project directory and list the following dependencies:

Copy code
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

## Usage

To run this project, navigate to the directory containing the project files, and run the Jupyter Notebooks:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the housing_price_analysis.ipynb file to view the project.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Initial analysis includes statistical summaries, correlation studies between features, and a deep dive into the distribution of key variables.

## Model Building

Several regression models are tested, including linear regression, ridge regression, and random forest regression. Model selection is based on cross-validation performance.

## Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated based on the RMSE score and the best-performing model is then fine-tuned to optimize its performance.

## Visualization

Various visualizations are included to interpret the model results and feature importances, providing insights into the data and the model's behavior.

## Conclusion

Insights derived from the models and implications for real estate valuation in Ames are discussed.
